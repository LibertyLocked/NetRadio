An Internet radio app package that includes a radio player and a social server.


Radio Player is an app that plays Internet radios using NAudio. Like other radio apps, you can custom your list of Internet radio stations. It can also connect to a Social Server where you can interact with other people who are also connected to the same server.

Social Server is a server software package that gives people who are connected to your server a place to hang out. They can chat, or see each other's favorite radio station. More features are planned.
